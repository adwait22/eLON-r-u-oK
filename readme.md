Few years ago, Elon Musk was sitting in traffic in Los Angeles, and thought about how cool it would be if he built a tunnel under the city.

So he built a tunnel under the city.

And he started selling hats for his tunnel.

50,000 hats later, he got bored with hats, and switched the hats out for flamethrowers.

He sold 20,000 of those, and then five days later he tied his car up to the most powerful
rocket ever made, and shot it into fuckin space.

And then the rocket fuckin landed itself.
